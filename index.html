					<p>There is a strong positive correlation between the incidence rate of Diabetes in a given state and the proportion of people in that state that are not part of the workforce. Typically, approximately 7-13% of the population in any given state have Diabetes and approximately 30-40% of the population in any given state are not in the workforce. Puerto Rico has by far the highest proportion of residents with Diabetes (15.7%) and the highest proportion of residents who are not part of the workforce (55.5%). It is the only place in the United States where over half of the population is not in the work force. There is also a strong negative correlation between the incidence rate of Diabetes in a given state and the proportion of people in that state who work at home.</p>
					<p>There is also a very strong correlation between the proportion of people with college degrees in a state and the proportion of people in that state that work in Management, Business, Science, or the Arts. Typically, approximately 15-35% of people in a state have college degrees and approximately 20-45% work in Management, Business, Science, or the Arts. With nearly half of residents holding college degrees, DC has the highest proportion of college graduates. DC is also the only place in the United States where over half of the population work in Management, Business, Science, or the Arts, with approximately 60% of the population working in those areas.</p>
					<p>Finally, there is a strong positive correlation between the proportion of people in a given state who work at home and the proportion of people in that state who have engaged in physical actvity in the past 30 days. There is also a strong negative correlation between the proportion of people in a given state who work at home and the proportion of people in that state who are not in the labor force. A large proportion of people not in the labor force are those with disabilities. As such, the people participating in physical activities may be those who are well enough to do so but who also have the time due to working at home.</p>
